Valorant Battle is a two player battle game made with HTML, SCSS and Javascript. The theme of the game is based on the video game Valorant. 
Each player selects an agent and then they battle it out. Once all of a player's agents have been defeated they lose. The "Simulated Battle" mode lets the game play itself, so you can watch the battles unfold.
Each agent is given a random strength score when created. The agent with the higher strength score wins. Once an agent wins, their strength score is decreased as they have taken damage from the battle.

## Features
- The game is two player with each side being able to pick their agent.
- The fighting agents can be chosen at random using the "Random Agent" button.
- When an agent wins a fight, their name will turn red to show they have taken damage.
- Each agent's strength value is random. The agent with the highest stength value wins the battle.
- The game can auto play using the "Simulated Battle" Mode. In this mode the agents are chosen automatically and they fight until one player wins.
- Once all a player's agents are defeated they lose.
- The game is themed on the video game Valorant.
