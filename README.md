Valorant Battle is a two player battle game made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The theme of the game is based on the video game Valorant. 

Each player selects an agent and then they battle it out. Once all of a player's agents have been defeated they lose. The "Simulated Battle" mode lets the game play itself, so you can watch the battles unfold.
